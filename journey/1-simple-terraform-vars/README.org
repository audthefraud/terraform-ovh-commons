* Disclaimer

This [[file:unikernels.org][document]] is written in org mode within emacs, then exported in 
various format such as markdown or html.
As such, you may  copy/paste code snippets in a shell terminal.

But if you're editing this document within emacs, you can use it as a runnable notebook. 
You just have to hit ~C-c C-c~ on src blocks and code will be executed &
outputted within the document, along with a shell buffer named ~*journey*~.

Don't forget to load babel support for shell lang by hitting ~C-c C-c~ on the
following block:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results output none :eval never-export
(org-babel-do-load-languages 'org-babel-load-languages '((shell . t)))
#+END_SRC

& then try it:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash :session *journey* :results output prepend pp :eval never-export
echo 'vi vi vi is the editor of the Beast!'
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: vi vi vi is the editor of the Beast!
: Go enter the Holy Church of Emacs!

_Tip_: you can hit ~Tab~ or ~Shift-Tab~ multiple times to collapse/uncollapse
paragraphs.


* Objective

This document is the second part of a [[../0-simple-terraform/README.md][step by step guide]] on how to use 
the [[https://terraform.io][Hashicorp Terraform]] tool with [[https://www.ovh.com/fr/public-cloud/instances/][OVH Cloud]]. It will help you create 
an openstack swift container on the region of your choice, but this
time with more advanced features of terraform, such as multiple ~tf~ 
files, variables, interpolation and outputs.


* Pre requisites

Please refer to the pre requisites paragraph of the [[../0-simple-terraform/README.md][first part]] of this guide.


* In pratice: Terraform basics: vars and outputs

You can ~cd~ in the second step directory and have a look at the directory structure.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash :session *journey* :results output pp  :eval never-export
cd 1-simple-terraform-vars
find .
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE bash 
.
./outputs.tf
./variables.tf
./main.tf
#+END_EXAMPLE  

You should now see a directory with a multiple ~.tf~ files.
Terraform takes a directory as input and concatenate all the ~.tf~ files it can
find.

By convention, we put all variables in a ~variables.tf~ file, all outputs in a
~outputs.tf~ file, and the rest in the ~main.tf~ files.

Here's the content of the ~variables.tf~:

#+BEGIN_SRC terraform :eval never-export
variable "region" {
  description = "The id of the openstack region"
  default = "GRA3"
}

variable "name" {
  description = "The name of the swift container for the terraform backend remote state"
  default = "demo-journey"
}
#+END_SRC

Alright. So now we know how to declare variables with default values and adding documentation. Now lets look at
how to use them in the ~main.tf~ file:

#+BEGIN_SRC terraform :eval never-export
provider "openstack" {
  region = "${var.region}"
}

resource "openstack_objectstorage_container_v1" "container" {
  region         = "${var.region}"
  name           = "${var.name}"
}
#+END_SRC

Here we can see basic "interpolation" features of terraform. Full documentation is 
available [[https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/interpolation.html][here]].

We also introduced the "openstack" provider, which had implicit settings based on the openrc
exported variables in the first example.

Here we force the target region to the input variable ~region~. We consider this as 
a best practice because relying on the openrc ~OS_REGION_NAME~ exported environment variable
is error prone.

Lastly, terraform can generate outputs that can be used in various ways. We'll have a look 
at it in the next steps.

Here's how outputs look like:

#+BEGIN_SRC terraform :eval never-export
output "helper" {
  description = "human friendly helper"
  value = <<DESC
You can now use your swift container as a terraform remote state backend, such as:
---
terraform {
  backend "swift" {
    container = "${openstack_objectstorage_container_v1.container.name}"
  }
}
---

and reference state outputs with:
---
data "terraform_remote_state" "foo" {
  backend = "swift"
  config {
    container = "${openstack_objectstorage_container_v1.container.name}"
  }
}
---
DESC
}
#+END_SRC

Here we have a human friendly output, defined by a multi lined value which 
references resources attributes with interpolation syntax, thus creating dependencies
within the terraform depencendy tree between the output and the resources it references.

Now that we've looked at the source code, let's apply it:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash :session *journey* :results output pp  :eval never-export
source ~/openrc.sh
terraform init
terraform apply
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE bash
openstack_objectstorage_container_v1.container: Creating...
  name:   "" => "demo-journey"
  region: "" => "GRA3"
openstack_objectstorage_container_v1.container: Creation complete after 0s (ID: demo-journey)

Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

Outputs:

helper = You can now use your swift container as a terraform remote state backend, such as:
---
terraform {
  backend "swift" {
    container = "demo-journey"
  }
}
---

and reference state outputs with:
---
data "terraform_remote_state" "foo" {
  backend = "swift"
  config {
    container = "demo-journey"
  }
}
---
#+END_EXAMPLE  


Ooops! I didn't want to create my container on the GRA3 region but on SBG3.
No problem, let's re apply our plan:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash :session *journey* :results output pp  :eval never-export
source ~/openrc.sh
terraform apply -var region=SBG3
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE bash
openstack_objectstorage_container_v1.container: Refreshing state... (ID: demo-spark)

An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
-/+ destroy and then create replacement

Terraform will perform the following actions:

-/+ openstack_objectstorage_container_v1.container (new resource required)
      id:     "demo-journey" => <computed> (forces new resource)
      name:   "demo-journey" => "demo-journey"
      region: "GRA3" => "SBG3" (forces new resource)


Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 1 to destroy.

Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value:
#+END_EXAMPLE  


OH OH! Terraform will destroy one resource and create a new one on the right region. Which is 
exactly what i want. So let's go:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE bash
  Enter a value: yes

openstack_objectstorage_container_v1.container: Destroying... (ID: demo-journey)
openstack_objectstorage_container_v1.container: Destruction complete after 0s
openstack_objectstorage_container_v1.container: Creating...
  name:   "" => "demo-journey"
  region: "" => "SBG3"
openstack_objectstorage_container_v1.container: Creation complete after 1s (ID: demo-journey)

Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 1 destroyed.

Outputs:

helper = You can now use your swift container as a terraform remote state backend, such as:
---
terraform {
  backend "swift" {
    container = "demo-journey"
  }
}
---

and reference state outputs with:
---
data "terraform_remote_state" "foo" {
  backend = "swift"
  config {
    container = "demo-journey"
  }
}
---
#+END_EXAMPLE  

Ok. We're done with this step. See you on step 3.

But before don't forget to clean up your infrastructure.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash :session *journey* :results output pp  :eval never-export
source ~/openrc.sh
terraform destroy -var region=SBG3
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE bash
openstack_objectstorage_container_v1.container: Refreshing state... (ID: demo-journey)

An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  - destroy

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  - openstack_objectstorage_container_v1.container


Plan: 0 to add, 0 to change, 1 to destroy.

Do you really want to destroy?
  Terraform will destroy all your managed infrastructure, as shown above.
  There is no undo. Only 'yes' will be accepted to confirm.

  Enter a value: yes

openstack_objectstorage_container_v1.container: Destroying... (ID: demo-journey)
openstack_objectstorage_container_v1.container: Destruction complete after 1s

Destroy complete! Resources: 1 destroyed.
#+END_EXAMPLE
