This directory hosts various helper scripts that ease some tedious tasks
such as openstack bash functions to interact with the API relying only
on very basic tools such as curl/jq

For example these scripts can be useful in other repo when you want travis
to build a packer image wihtout having to install a full python openstack cli.
